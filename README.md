EDS XML to Zabbix
=================

This is a little server I knocked up to send EDS XML data to Zabbix

EDS XML data includes Temperature, Humidity, etc. This is useful in
data center monitoring.

To install, download and run "npm install"

It's designed for CentOS, so copy the init script to /etc/init.d and edit
it according to your install location.

Enjoy!
